## Description
I wanted to learn the fundamentals of front-end web development so I created a personal image gallery. Nothing fancy, just a small and simple website built with HTML, CSS, and a bit of Javascript.

**Main features I spent time working on:**
  - a functional menu navigation bar
  - responsive display for desktop / mobile devices
  - responsive gallery (display: grid)
  - responsive about page (display: flex)
  - image gallery functionality when clicking on an image (lightbox)
  - form functionality for the contact page
  - colour changing text
